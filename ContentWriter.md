## STEP 1: WRITE DOCUMENTATION CONTENT
- First analyze what kind of content is required to solve the gap. Sometimes you just need a note. Sometimes you need detailed steps. Sometimes you need reference information.
- Based on this, create content using language appropriate for a user guide. Keep information to the necessary. 
-  Focus on technical solution, not analysis. Focus on the context as well. Now create actual content that can be used directly in the identified context. Your output can include
  * Problem summary/statement (this is only for reference and not to include in doc)
  * Documentation strategy (this is for reference only. But includes advise on how the problem can be solved)
Actual content:
  * Caveats or limitations (if applicable)
  * Configuration Steps and Behavior Explanation (If applicable)
  * WOrkaround (if appliable)
  * Recommended format to best provide information to the customer
  * Any other applicable information.
